#### About Me
My name is Chujun Zhang. I am a PhD student at the Hall Lab at the University of Birmingham, UK. My research focuses on human–microbe interactions, with a particular emphasis on the early-life gut microbiome. I work with large-scale microbiome datasets to investigate geographic structuring, genomic evolution, and functional diversification of probiotics. I have a strong passion for species evolution and ecological diversity, and I remain fascinated by the complexity of life on our blue planet🌏.
